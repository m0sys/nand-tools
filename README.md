> Nand2Tetris II tools built using C++

## Content

This repo contains the [Hack Assembler](https://github.com/m0sys/nand-tools/tree/master/cc/dev/hack_assembler), [Hack VM](https://github.com/m0sys/nand-tools/tree/master/cc/dev/hack_vm), [Jack Compiler](https://github.com/m0sys/nand-tools/tree/master/cc/dev/jack_compiler) represented as 3 independent C++ projects.
Ideally, these would be packaged as one project with 3 independent libraries using a professional grade cmake template such as the [cmake_cpp_starter](https://github.com/m0sys/cmake-cpp-starter).

## How to Run Tests

First it is required to build the project by going to its root folder and running the `build.sh` script.
Then it will be possible to run the tests using `./scripts/run_tests.sh`.
