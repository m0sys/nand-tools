<!-- VALUABLE QUOTES -->

## Valuable Quotes

 ![Build your own X](feynman.png)

> Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. - Whitehead (COD 2017)

> Less is more. - Robert Browning (COD 2017)

> I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. - Feynman

> Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible. - Feynman

> [I think that everything is possible as long as you put your mind to it and you put the work and time into it. I think your mind really controls everything. - Michael Phelps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct8HQTNYfIs)

> If we hear, we forget. If we see, we remember. If we do, we understand. - Proverb

> **The GE bill for $1000 (Patt & Patel 2005):**
>
> | Incident                                      |  $$$   |
> | :-------------------------------------------- | :----: |
> | Turning a screw 35 degrees counterclockwise   |  0.75  |
> | *Knowing which screw to turn and by how much* | 999.25 |

> As you approach your study and practice of computing, we urge you to take the opposite approach - that hardware and software are names for components of two parts of a computing system that work best when they are designed by someone who took into account the capabilities and limitations of both. - Patt & Patel (2005)

> Code that is never runs serves no purpose. It is utter garbage. To code for the sake of the code itself is therefore pointless. The goal is to write the code which runs as expected. That is what makes you the programmer. - Moe

> The best way to predict the Future is to invent it. - Alan Kay

> The Hand that drew the hand was one and the same. - Moe

> I imagine 99% of your thought process is protecting your self-conception, and 98% of that is wrong. Now you got the math right. - Jim Keller

> Never waste time. - American Proverb (COD 2017)

> You know what's overrated? Compute Science/Software Engineering. You know what's so underrated? Compute Engineering/Hardware Engineering. - Moe (2021/11/13) 

> Supercomputer: Any machine still on the drawing board. - Stan Kelly-Bootle, 1981 (COD 2017)

> What I hear, I forget; What I see, I remember; What I do, I understand. - Confucius (551 - 479 B.C.E)

> The only kind of learning which significantly influences behaviour is self-discovered or self-appropriated - truth that has been assimilated in experience. - Carl Rogers (ECS, Second Edition) 

> If Elon can build Starship I can build Robochip. - M0 (2021/11/19)

> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing. - [Alan Perlis](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)

## Computer Architecture Principles

<!-- GOAL -->

## GOAL (For the 3 Months) [2021/9/28]

- BUILD MY FIRST MICROPROCESSOR! (SINGLE CORE FIRST then MULTI-CORE) 
- HOW DOES ONE DESIGN AND BUILD A MICROPROCESSOR?

## TODO

1. Write a readme for each individual microarchitecture with good diagrams to depict the datapath + controller.
